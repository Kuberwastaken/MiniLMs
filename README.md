## 📈 SYNEVA Evolution (Archive)

### v0: Initial Concept

**#file:v0.html**

The initial prototype established the core concept: create a minimal chatbot in plain JavaScript.

**Key Features:**
- Basic random response generation
- Limited vocabulary (51 words)
- Simple pattern-based responses
- Minimal styling
- Linear congruential PRNG for consistent random selection

**Technical Analysis:**
```javascript
// Core PRNG implementation
let s=1;
const r=()=>(s=(s*9301+49297)%233280)/233280;
```

The initial approach used a very simplistic response mechanism:
- A fixed array of patterns (P) containing word indices
- Random selection from these patterns
- No context tracking or memory

**Size:** ~800 bytes
**Limitations:** No memory, limited vocabulary, responses often nonsensical

**What Worked:**
- Extremely small codebase
- Basic conversation capability
- Linear congruential generator for deterministic randomness

**What Didn't:**
- Poor user experience
- No contextual awareness
- Simplistic UI

### v1: Improved UI & Context

**#file:v1.html**

v1 represented a significant evolution with proper HTML structure, CSS styling, and enhanced language capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Chat bubbles UI with proper DOM rendering
- Topic memory to track conversation subjects
- Sentiment analysis
- Transition patterns for more coherent responses
- Proper DOCTYPE and meta tags

**Technical Analysis:**
```javascript
// Memory tracking - major new addition
memory: {
  topics: [],           // Remember topics
  lastSentiment: 0,     // Remember sentiment
  lastWords: [],        // Last few words from user
  questionCount: 0,     // Track conversational flow
  turnCount: 0          // Count conversation turns
}
```

This version introduced a more sophisticated approach:
- Pattern-based templates with slot-filling
