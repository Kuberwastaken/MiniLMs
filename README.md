## üîç Overview

15ABELLA (15kB Adaptive Behavioral Engine for Low-memory Linguistic Applications) is an experimental neural network-based chatbot designed to operate within a strict 15KB size constraint. The project explores efficient AI implementations while providing meaningful conversational capabilities. 

This project evolved from our work on SYNEVA, which focused on extreme compression to fit within a QR code. 15ABELLA relaxes those constraints slightly to prioritize functionality and user experience while maintaining a lightweight footprint.

## üîÑ Why We Pivoted from SYNEVA

After extensive development of SYNEVA, we reached a crucial realization: the QR code size constraint (approximately 2.5KB) was fundamentally limiting the potential of our neural network approach. While we successfully implemented a character-level neural network in that space, several limitations became apparent:

1. **Limited Context Understanding**: The compressed network couldn't maintain sufficient conversation history.
2. **Template Dependency**: Responses relied too heavily on pre-defined templates rather than true generation.
3. **Lack of Learning Capability**: No room for weights adjustment or actual learning.
4. **Poor Response Variety**: The extreme compression led to repetitive interactions.

With 15ABELLA, we've expanded our size budget to 15KB - still remarkably small for a neural chatbot, but enough space to implement more sophisticated architectures that overcome SYNEVA's limitations while remaining incredibly lightweight compared to typical modern chatbots.

The v10.html version of SYNEVA (our last iteration) included significant improvements as documented in the header comments:

```html
<!-- 
SYNEVA v10 Improvements over v9:
1. Enhanced Neural Network: Improved model with better context weights and response generation
2. Memory System: Now remembers user topics and can reference them in later conversation
3. Context Awareness: Tracks conversation history to provide more coherent responses
4. Natural Language: More diverse response templates with variable substitution
5. UI Improvements: Cleaner interface with better color coding and spacing
6. Code Efficiency: Reduced file size (3.9KB vs 4.3KB) with more functionality
7. Response Variety: Prevents repetition by tracking recent responses
8. Topic Detection: Better keyword recognition for more relevant answers
9. Conversation Continuity: Can refer back to previous subjects naturally
10. Specialized Handling: Custom responses for philosophical questions and short answers

```

These improvements represented the maximum potential of our QR-sized neural network. With 15ABELLA, we're building on these achievements while embracing a more realistic size constraint.

## üìà SYNEVA Evolution (Archive)

### v0: Initial Concept

**#file:v0.html**

The initial prototype established the core concept: create a minimal chatbot in plain JavaScript.

**Key Features:**
- Basic random response generation
- Limited vocabulary (51 words)
- Simple pattern-based responses
- Minimal styling
- Linear congruential PRNG for consistent random selection

**Technical Analysis:**
```javascript
// Core PRNG implementation
let s=1;
const r=()=>(s=(s*9301+49297)%233280)/233280;
```

The initial approach used a very simplistic response mechanism:
- A fixed array of patterns (P) containing word indices
- Random selection from these patterns
- No context tracking or memory

**Size:** ~800 bytes
**Limitations:** No memory, limited vocabulary, responses often nonsensical

**What Worked:**
- Extremely small codebase
- Basic conversation capability
- Linear congruential generator for deterministic randomness

**What Didn't:**
- Poor user experience
- No contextual awareness
- Simplistic UI

### v1: Improved UI & Context

**#file:v1.html**

v1 represented a significant evolution with proper HTML structure, CSS styling, and enhanced language capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Chat bubbles UI with proper DOM rendering

- Sentiment analysis
- Transition patterns for more coherent responses
- Proper DOCTYPE and meta tags

**Technical Analysis:**
```javascript
// Memory tracking - major new addition
memory: {
  topics: [],           // Remember topics
  lastSentiment: 0,     // Remember sentiment
  lastWords: [],        // Last few words from user
  questionCount: 0,     // Track conversational flow
  turnCount: 0          // Count conversation turns
}
```

This version introduced a more sophisticated approach:
- Pattern-based templates with slot-filling
- Sentiment analysis to detect emotional tone

  w:"I,you,me,is,are,do,what,how,why,like,think,feel,know,tell,yes,no,not...".split(","),
  p:[[1,4,20], [0,11,25], /* ... */],
  t:[],
  s:0,
  k:[]
  // ...
}
```

The major innovation was aggressive optimization:
