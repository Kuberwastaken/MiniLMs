## 🔍 Overview

SYNEVA (Syntactical Evaluation of Verbal Analysis) is an experimental project to create a neural network-based chatbot that fits entirely inside a QR code. The project explores extreme code compression techniques while maintaining reasonable AI functionality.

The key achievement is a complete neural network architecture implemented in less than 2.5KB of JavaScript, which can fit into a high-density QR code while providing contextual responses, basic memory, and character-level natural language processing.

## 📈 Evolution

### v0: Initial Concept

**#file:v0.html**

The initial prototype established the core concept: create a minimal chatbot in plain JavaScript.

**Key Features:**
- Basic random response generation
- Limited vocabulary (51 words)
- Simple pattern-based responses
- Minimal styling
- Linear congruential PRNG for consistent random selection

**Technical Analysis:**
```javascript
// Core PRNG implementation
let s=1;
const r=()=>(s=(s*9301+49297)%233280)/233280;
```

The initial approach used a very simplistic response mechanism:
- A fixed array of patterns (P) containing word indices
- Random selection from these patterns
- No context tracking or memory

**Size:** ~800 bytes
**Limitations:** No memory, limited vocabulary, responses often nonsensical

**What Worked:**
- Extremely small codebase
- Basic conversation capability
- Linear congruential generator for deterministic randomness

**What Didn't:**
- Poor user experience
- No contextual awareness
- Simplistic UI

### v1: Improved UI & Context

**#file:v1.html**

v1 represented a significant evolution with proper HTML structure, CSS styling, and enhanced language capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Chat bubbles UI with proper DOM rendering
- Topic memory to track conversation subjects
- Sentiment analysis
- Transition patterns for more coherent responses
- Proper DOCTYPE and meta tags

**Technical Analysis:**
```javascript
// Memory tracking - major new addition
memory: {
  topics: [],           // Remember topics
  lastSentiment: 0,     // Remember sentiment
  lastWords: [],        // Last few words from user
  questionCount: 0,     // Track conversational flow
  turnCount: 0          // Count conversation turns
}
```

This version introduced a more sophisticated approach:
- Pattern-based templates with slot-filling
- Sentiment analysis to detect emotional tone
- Memory of conversation topics

**Size:** ~5KB
**Architecture:** Object-oriented with distinct methods for analysis, memory, and generation

**What Worked:**

  p:[[1,4,20], [0,11,25], /* ... */],
  t:[],
  s:0,
  k:[]
  // ...
}
```

The major innovation was aggressive optimization:

}
```

**Size:** ~2.5KB

## 📦 Size Optimization Techniques

The project employed several innovative techniques to minimize code size:

   ```javascript
   // Generate weights from seed instead of storing them
   let seed = 42;
   seed = (seed * 9301 + 49297) % 233280;
   weight = (seed / 233280) - 0.5;
   ```

2. **Single-Letter Variable Names**
   ```javascript
   // From v9-v10
   T=class{constructor(){this.m=[],this.l=-1,this.init()}}
   ```

3. **Array-Based Configuration**

   // From v9-v10
   c={v:70,e:6,h:12,o:10,m:32,r:3}
   ```

4. **Template String Split**
   ```javascript
   // Split multi-line strings with pipe characters
   A="SSSSS  Y   Y  N   N  EEEEE  V   V     A    |S..."
   L=A.split("|").map(s=>"    "+s).join("\n")
   ```

5. **Omitted Semicolons and Brackets**
   ```javascript
   // Relying on JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion
   f.g&&(b[0]+=1)
   f.i&&(b[1]+=1)
   ```

6. **Short Circuit Evaluation**
   ```javascript
   // Using && for conditional execution
   e.key=="Enter"&&v&&(o.innerHTML+=`...`,i.value="")
   ```

7. **Bit Shifting for Integer Division**
   ```javascript
   // Using ~~ instead of Math.floor
   return R[m][~~(Math.random()*R[m].length)]
   ```
